#### Question:
>I was told there was something at IP shell2017.picoctf.com with port 53382. How do I get there? Do I need a ship for the port?

#### Solution:
Use the *netcat* command by typing as follows `nc shell2017.picoctf.com 53382`

The output would be:
```
nc shell2017.picoctf.com 53382
Yay! You made it!                                        
Take a flag!
